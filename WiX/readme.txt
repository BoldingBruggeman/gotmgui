This directory contains everything needed to build a GOTM-GUI installation package for Windows.

Basically it converts the GOTM-GUI application directory ../dist as generated by "../setup.py py2exe" into a single Windows Installer MSI file, which can directly be executed on all recent versions of Windows.

For this purpose the open-source Windows Installer XML (WIX) toolset is used, http://wix.sourceforge.net. This is a freely distributed, stand-alone program (it does not require Visual Studio) that takes a XML-based description of an application setup and converts it into a single MSI file. Some Python (buildmsi.py) is used as well to enumerate all files in the application directory and add these to the XML that describes the application setup.

Building an MSI package from the ../dist application directory now is as simple as executing

"buildmsi.py VERSION"

where VERSION must be of the format x.x.x, each x being an integer number. The GOTM-GUI version at the time of writing is 0.95.0. Newer packages MUST ALWAYS have a higher version number for the in-place upgrade functionality to work.

Note that you have to have the Windows Installer XML (WIX) toolset installed, as well as the Win32 extensions for Python module. Get both from:
